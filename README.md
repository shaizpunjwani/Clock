# Clock


We can also create clock in python by using some simple modules and with basic gui by implementing only 1 function.

#Functions

1) Time(): We loaded the time and date first. Then we called config in label because to display our text and time in label. Then we called the after function as it is an callback function and is used to callback after an delay of millisecond as given parameter.

Then setted our simple gui by calling the above function.


#Modules
1) Tkinter: helps to build gui
2) time: used to display time
3) datetime: used to display current datetime.
